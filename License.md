## Licenses

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, OCP must have a  [OCP Software Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/OCP-Software-GitHub-Process/blob/master/legal/OCP%20SW%20CLA%2008032020.pdf) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the user and OCP; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

Specifications in the repository are subject to either the  [OCP Contribution License Agreement](https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-cla) (with appropriate Hardware License acknowledgement) or  [Open Web Foundation (OWF) CLA](https://www.opencompute.org/documents/owf-cla)  (with signed OWFa1.0 Final Spec Agreement).
