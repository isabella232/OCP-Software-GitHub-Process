We welcome everyone to contribute to any OCP Software project. Membership, in good
standing, is required to make a contribution to OCP. To find out if your company is a current
member, please check out the [OCP Membership Directory]([https://www.opencompute.org/membership/membership-organizational-directory](https://www.opencompute.org/membership/membership-organizational-directory)). If you or your company would like
to become a member, please sign a membership agreement on the OCP website [here]([https://www.opencompute.org/membership/agreements](https://www.opencompute.org/membership/agreements)).
In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person
or entity, OCP must have an OCP Software Contributor License Agreement on file that has been
signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms. This license is for your
protection as a Contributor as well as the user and OCP; it does not change your rights to use
your own Contributions for any other purpose.

Please follow the process and sign the CLA [here](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/OCP-Software-GitHub-Process/blob/master/legal/OCP%20SW%20CLA%2008032020.pdf).
